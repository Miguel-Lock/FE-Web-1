    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Bio:</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Miguel Lock. I am a student at Franciscan University of Steubenville. 
        I am a Computer Science major with minors in Cybersecurity and Mathematics. 
        I am set to graduate in December of 2025.
    </p>
    <h2>Work Experience:</h2>
    <p>
        In Fall of 2024, I was hired as a contractor to help develop a product demo in Figma for Imaging Biometrics, a Wisconsin-based software development company.
        Pleased with my work, Imaging Biometrics extended a Summer internship offer to me.
        I accepted their offer, and am currently working part-time remote for IB.
        In the summer, I will work for the company as a full-time remote employee.
        I am particularly greatful for the opportunity to work for a company creating products that will actually make a difference in the real world, instead of Roblox or something similarly useless. 
    </p>

    <h2>Project Experience:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>ScriptOS application for the USCCB</b>
        </li>
            <p>
                For my Senior Capstone project (2024-2025), I am working in a team of six developers to create a web application for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.
                For background, a current stamp of approvaal - a declaration of conformity - exists.
                Current methods for publishers to obtain this approval are slow and inefficient.
                Long, unweildy email threads facilitate communiction between the publishers and USCCB Consultants.
                If any changes need to be made, the publishing company has to ensure the proper edits are made, re-format the book, and send it back to the USCCB.
                Few publishing companies are able to undergo the financial burden of the process, which currently takes years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our solution is a custom-built web application that facilitates communication between the publishers and USCCB.
                Publishers can submit a proposal, which can be approved and become a project.
                Instead of submitting a completed book, a publisher can submit a single chapter at a time.
                The publishers and consultants talk through a comments thread built into the PDF.
                If any changes need to be made, the publisher can submit a new version of each chapter.
                Once all chapters are approved, the project is presented to the bishop for final approval.
            </p>
            <p>
                My role in the SCRUM team is assistant SCRUM master.
                My role in the project is the cloud manager and assistant front-end developer.
                We use React for the front-end, Ruby on Rails for the back-end, and MSSQL for the database.
                Some of the work I am most proud of is replacing existant redundant code to implement tempates for code reusability.
                Additionally, my work has been key in developing the wireframes and implementing my work on the wireframes in the project.

            <b>Contractor - Figma Designer (Imaging Biometrics)</b>
        </li>
        <p>
            I was hired as a contractor to help develop a product demo in Figma for Imaging Biometrics, a Wisconsin-based software development company.
            The product is a messaging app called "Nimble" that will allow doctors to have more streamlined communicateion about their patients.
            The Figma demo was in progress, but IB had to speed up development so Blackford, a company they were partnering with, could demo the product at a conference.
            Although I had no experience with Figma, I was able to learn the software quickly and immediately start adding features.
            I would assist with design descisions, and met with our company and Blackford to discuss the product and work on features.
        </p>
        <li>
            <b>Engineering Intern (Imaging Biometrics)</b>
        </li>
        <p>
            Imaging Biometrics was pleased with my ability to adapt and communicate, and extended a Summer internship offer to me.
            I accepted their offer, and am currently working part-time remote for IB while in school.
            We are using Dart and Dart Frog to develop "Nimble" which I talked about above.
            I am a full-stack developer on the project.
            We have weely team meetings with the development Team.
            We meet every other meeting with stakeholders - company memebers our stakeholders.
            We also meet with Blackford - they were very pleased with our work on the Figma product demo, and they are continuing as partners with Imaging Biometrics.
        </p>
