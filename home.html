    <h2>Bio:</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Miguel Lock. I am a student at Franciscan University of Steubenville. 
        I am a Computer Science major with minors in Cybersecurity and Mathematics. 
        I am set to graduate in December of 2025.
    </p>
    <h2>Work Experience:</h2>
    <p>
        In Fall of 2024, I was hired as a contracter to help develop a product demo in Figma for Imaging Biometrics, a Wisconsin-based software development company.
        Pleased with my work, Imaging Biometrics extended a Summer internship offer to me.
        I accepted their offer, and am currently working part-time remote for IB.
        In the summer, I will work for the company as a full-time remote employee.
        I am particularly greatful for the opportunity to work for a company creating products that will actually make a difference in the real world, instead of Roblox or something similarly useless.

    <h2>Project Experience:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>ScriptOS application for the USCCB</li>
            <p>
                For my Senior Capstone project, I am working in a team of six developers to create a web application for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.
                For background, a current stamp of approvaal - a declaration of conformity - exists.
                Current methods for publishers to obtain this approval are slow and inefficient.
                Long, unweildy email threads facilitate communiction between the publishers and USCCB Consultants.
                If any changes need to be made, the publishing company has to ensure the proper edits are made, re-format the book, and send it back to the USCCB.
                Few publishing companies are able to undergo the financial burden of the process, which currently takes years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our solution is a custom-built web application that facilitates communication between the publishers and USCCB.
                Publishers can submit a proposal, which can be approved and become a project.
                Instead of submitting a completed book, a publisher can submit a single chapter at a time.
                The publishers and consultants talk through a comments thread built into the PDF.
                If any changes need to be made, the publisher can submit a new version of each chapter.
                Once all chapters are approved, the project is presented to the bishop for final approval.
